## SpaceX Falcon-9 Success Landing Prediction
### _Predicting the Successful Landing of SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage_

In this capstone project, we aim to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land after a rocket launch. SpaceX markets Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than other providers, which charge upwards of $165 million per launch. This cost efficiency is largely due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. By predicting the likelihood of a successful landing, we can better estimate the cost savings and competitive advantage for SpaceX.

### Data Collection with Web Scraping and Data Wrangling
#### _Objectives_
- Write Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame.
- Convert a JSON file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Create a Jupyter Notebook and make it shareable using GitHub.
- Apply data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem.
- Use data analysis tools to load a dataset, clean it, and uncover interesting insights.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Make use of a RESTful API and web scraping to gather data. Convert the data into a DataFrame and perform data wrangling to prepare it for analysis.
#### _Objectives_
- Create scatter plots and bar charts by writing Python code to analyze data in a Pandas DataFrame.
- Write Python code to conduct EDA by manipulating data in a Pandas DataFrame.
- Write and execute SQL queries to select and sort data.
- Use data visualization skills to visualize the data and extract meaningful patterns to guide the modeling process.

### Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards
Build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash and create an interactive map to analyze launch site proximity using the Folium library.
#### _Objectives_
- Build an interactive dashboard that includes pie charts and scatter plots to analyze data with the Plotly Dash library.
- Calculate distances on an interactive map using Python code with the Folium library.
- Generate interactive maps, plot coordinates, and mark clusters using Python code with the Folium library.
- Create a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash.
- Develop an interactive map to analyze launch site proximity with Folium.

### Predictive Analysis (Classification)
In this module, we will use machine learning to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. The data will be split into training and test sets to find the best hyperparameters for Support Vector Machines (SVM), Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. We will then identify the best-performing method using test data.
#### _Objectives_
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train different classification models.
- Conduct hyperparameter grid search to optimize models.
- Use machine learning skills to build a predictive model to enhance business efficiency.

This project will involve a comprehensive approach to data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling, providing valuable insights and tools to understand and predict the successful landing of SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets.
